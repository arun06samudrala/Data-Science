Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System
  This project develops a collaborative filtering recommendation system using matrix factorization to predict user ratings for movies based on historical user-item interactions. The system recommends movies tailored to users' preferences by leveraging patterns from similar users.

  Evaluation: The model is assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
  Future Improvements: Incorporate additional features (e.g., movie genres), experiment with varying latent factors, and optimize learning rates to enhance performance.

Content-Based Filtering Recommendation System
  This project implements a content-based filtering system that recommends movies based on users' past ratings and preferences. It leverages user and movie features to improve recommendation accuracy.

  Personalized Recommendations: Suggests movies aligned with users' historical ratings and preferences.

  Feature Engineering: Includes average user ratings per genre, average movie ratings, and the number of ratings per movie.

  Neural Network Architecture: Employs two neural networks—one for user features and one for movie features—with regularization and batch normalization to boost performance. The final prediction is derived from the dot product of the network outputs.

  Top-N Recommendations: A get_top_n_recommendations function retrieves the top N movie recommendations for a user, sorted by predicted ratings.

Hand Digit Recognition
  This project focuses on classifying hand signs representing digits (0–5) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The aim is to accurately recognize hand gestures for applications like gesture-based control systems and assistive technologies.

  Model Architecture: The CNN consists of Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling2D → Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling2D → Flatten → Dense layers, extracting spatial features and classifying digits through a fully connected layer.
  Training Details:

  Loss: Categorical Crossentropy
  Optimizer: Adam
  Metric: Accuracy
  Input: Preprocessed and normalized hand sign images

ResNet-50 Implementation
  This project implements a ResNet-50 model, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with 50 layers, built from scratch for image classification tasks. ResNet-50 introduces residual learning through shortcut connections, allowing the network to learn identity functions and mitigate vanishing gradient issues, enabling effective training of deep architectures.

  Architecture Details:

  Structure: Comprises 5 stages with convolutional blocks, each containing multiple residual units. Each residual unit includes 3 convolutional layers (1x1, 3x3, 1x1) with shortcut connections, followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation.
  Parameters: Approximately 25.6 million trainable parameters, leveraging bottleneck layers to reduce computational complexity.
  Input: Expects preprocessed images (e.g., 224x224x3, normalized to [-1, 1] or [0, 1], depending on the dataset).


  Training Details:

  Current Dataset: Trained on a small dataset (specific dataset not specified), which limits the model’s ability to generalize due to insufficient diversity and volume of data.
  Optimizer: Adam (or SGD with momentum, depending on implementation).
  Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy for multi-class classification.
  Metrics: Accuracy and loss monitored during training.


  Challenges: The small dataset size leads to overfitting and suboptimal feature learning, as ResNet-50’s depth requires large, diverse datasets (e.g., ImageNet with 1M+ images) to fully exploit its capacity.
  Results: Preliminary results show limited performance due to dataset constraints, with accuracy metrics pending further training.
  Future Improvements:

  Train on a larger dataset, such as ImageNet or a domain-specific dataset, to leverage ResNet-50’s depth.
  Implement data augmentation (e.g., random crops, flips, rotations) to enhance generalization.
  Experiment with transfer learning by fine-tuning a pretrained ResNet-50 model to reduce training time and improve performance.
  Optimize hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) and explore regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, weight decay) to mitigate overfitting.

U-Net for Semantic Segmentation
  This project implements a U-Net model from scratch for semantic segmentation, trained on the Cityscapes dataset to classify pixels in urban scene images into 19 semantic classes (e.g., road, car, pedestrian). U-Net’s encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections enables precise localization and context-aware segmentation, making it ideal for dense prediction tasks.

  Architecture Details:

  Structure: Symmetric encoder-decoder design with convolutional blocks. The encoder extracts features through Conv2D, ReLU, and MaxPooling layers, while the decoder upsamples features using transposed convolutions or upsampling, with skip connections to preserve spatial details.

  Trained for 3 epochs, which is insufficient for convergence in a complex task like semantic segmentation.


Challenges: Limited training (3 epochs) results in underfitting, with the model failing to capture intricate patterns in the Cityscapes dataset. High-resolution images (1024x2048) and class imbalance (e.g., rare classes like bicycle) pose additional challenges.
Results: Current performance is suboptimal (mIoU and accuracy metrics pending), but early qualitative results show basic segmentation capabilities. Extended training is expected to improve results significantly.
Future Improvements:

Train for more epochs (e.g., 50–100) with early stopping to ensure convergence.
Apply data augmentation (e.g., random crops, flips, color jitter) to improve robustness.
Experiment with advanced loss functions (e.g., weighted crossentropy, focal loss) to address class imbalance.
Optimize input resolution or use patch-based training to manage memory constraints with high-resolution images.
Incorporate pretrained backbones (e.g., ResNet or EfficientNet) in the encoder to enhance feature extraction.
