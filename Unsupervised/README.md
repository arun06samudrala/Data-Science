KMeans Clustering:
  1) The dataset contains customer information who had visited a mall
  2) The first part of the notebook contains code for EDA (cleaning dataset, identifying outliers). But the dataset used appears to be clean.
  3) Unwanted columns were dropped and then the data was scaled.
  4) Inertia and Silhouette scores were plotted against clusters to determine the optimal cluster value.
  5) A scatterplot was plotted (Age vs Income) to visualize clusters.
  6) Evaluation: This doesn't seem to be a great model as there seem to be overlaps of clusters as depicted in the scatterplot and by looking at the silhouette score.
